      <h2>Chest X-Ray Disease Detection</h2>
      <p>
        We created different models to classify many types of diseases in chest x-ray images
Diseases include pneumonia, hernia, emphysema, and many more
Our goal was to create models that would detect if an image contains a disease and also predict which specific disease the image shows
We used a random forest classifier for our simple model and a CNN for our more advanced model
The steps for this project included loading and preprocessing the dataset, training the models, and comparing their performance to determine which had the best results

      <h2>Concrete Crack Detection</h2>
      <p>
        When it comes to classification problems in Data Science and Machine Learning, the utility of images can often be very useful to do so. 
        For this particular project, a large directory of images was provided, within the directory there were two sub-directories split into categories of Cracked, 
        and Non-cracked, then within those directories there were nested directories that consisted of the type, or structure of concrete, which were of the following: 
        pavement, deck, and wall. Our overall goal was to consider two machine learning processes/algorithms that we learned in class, and apply those models to these 
        different kinds of images to make a model that can optimally classify whether or not images are cracked. After these models are created, these models will be 
        optimized utilizing some form of cross validation to make improvements.
